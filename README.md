## My study notes of data structure and algorithm written in Python
- Codes are referenced from [PegasusWang's tutorial](https://github.com/PegasusWang/python_data_structures_and_algorithms), the sub-folder ["python_data_structures_and_algorithms"](/python_data_structures_and_algorithms) is a copy of his tutorial.
- My study notes and codes are stored in sub-folder ["1" ](/1).
    - Reorder some categories;
    - Add more comments to hard-to-understand parts;
    - Refactor the building of some data structures and algorithems
        - Linkedlist
        - Doubly Linkedlist
        - Queue
        - Hash Map
        - LFU
- Sub-folder ["2"](/2) contains my second round practice of these data structures which you can just ignore.

### Thanks to [PegasusWang](https://github.com/PegasusWang) for this fantastic tutorial
